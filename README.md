# Hotel management Java project

## Introduction
For the purpose of solving the problems related to the managing documentations, a hotel management 
desktop application is made to help reducing the managing efforts of the hotel operators.

The hotel management Java application is established to digitalize a fraction of hotel management. 

This project includes 3 team-members: Nguyen Dang Khoa, 
Truong Hoang Phuong Nhu and Ha Xuan Huy, working in 4 months to complete the project.

Made to accomplish Java-OOP modular on semester 3 of VGU.

### 4. Maven JavaFX build & run
1. Go to Javafx client's folder `cd hotelClient`
2. Build package by using command `maven package`
3. Run ".jar" file by `java --module-path <your-javafx-sdk-path> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,mysql.connector -jar target\hotelmanagement-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
  + Download JavaFX SDK from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
  + Place JavaFX SDK as your favourite (note it for later usage).
  + Add your JavaFX SDK path to the command. Example: `java --module-path E:\javafx-sdk-15.0.1\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,mysql.connector -jar target\hotelmanagement-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
